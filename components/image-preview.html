<h1>How to show images as part of the blog index? </h1>

<p><img alt="" src="../../images/blog/image-preview/image1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Simple. Just insert the image right after the title. </p>
<p>The build takes the first paragraph to use as part of the preview in the blog index. If the first thing it finds is a picture, it will show the picture.</p>
<p>This applies to any kind of document.</p>
